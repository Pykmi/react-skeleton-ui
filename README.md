# React Skeleton UI

React Skeleton UI is a React conversion of Dave Gamache's [Skeleton boilerplate](http://getskeleton.com/), using [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#extending-styles) instead of CSS / SCSS files. It is both simple, clean and responsive, and just like the original, it is meant to be *boilerplate*, an easy place to begin building your own UI library.

## Getting Started
`npm install react-skeleton-ui`

## Documentation

## Special Thanks
To [Dan Hedgecock](https://github.com/DHedgecock) for allowing me to take over his depracated npm package of the same name. I have bumped the version of the original package to avoid confusion from this exchange. Dan's original legacy package can still be found on his github profile.
